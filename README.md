## Description
The useState hook in React allows you to add state to functional components. It lets you create a state variable and a function to update that state. Whenever the state is updated, the component re-renders to reflect the new state. This is useful for managing dynamic data in your application, such as user inputs or API responses. Here's a simple example of how it's used:

```
const [count, setCount] = useState(0); 
```

In this case, count is the state variable, and setCount is the function to update it.
